        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup very finely minced onion</li>
            <li>1 small clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sweet paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground mustard seed</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground mace</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg white</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor, puree the onion, garlic, coriander, 
                paprika, mustard seed, marjoram, and mace. Add the milk, egg white, sugar, 
                salt, and pepper and combine well. Remove to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>One at a time, grind the pork, beef, and fat cubes through the fine blade 
                of a meat grinder. Combine the 3 ingredients and grind them together.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the pureed seasonings with the meat and mix 
                with your hands. Wet your hands with cold water to prevent the mixture 
                from sticking.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes and then grind it again. 
                Prepare the casings.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, rinse the casing well under cool running water to remove 
                the salt. Place it in a bowl of cool water and soak for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After soaking, run cool water over the casing. Slip one end of the 
                casing over the faucet nozzle and firmly hold it in place. Turn on 
                the cold water, gently at first, and then more forcefully. This will 
                flush out any salt in the casing and help you spot any breaks. Should 
                you find one, simply snip out a small section of the casing.</li>
            <li>Put the casing in a bowl of water and add a splash of white vinegar. 
                (A tablespoon of vinegar per cup of water is sufficient.) The vinegar 
                softens the casing and makes it more transparent, which in turn makes 
                the hot dog look nicer. Leave the casing in the water and vinegar 
                solution until you are ready to use it. Rinse it well and drain before 
                stuffing.</li>
            <li>Using a sausage stuffer, fill the casings with the meat mixture 
                and twist them off into 6-inch links.</li>
            <li>Parboil the links (but don't separate them) in simmering water for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the franks in a bowl of ice water and chill.</li>
            <li>Remove, pat dry, and refrigerate. You can refrigerate them for up 
                to one week or freeze them for future use.</li>
        </ol>
