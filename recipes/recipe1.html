        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Simply the stereotypical Mexican dish, tacos in their most basic 
            definition are corn or flour tortillas which wrap or fold around a typically 
            meaty filling. Theyâ€™re then usually topped with cebollita y cilantro 
            (diced onion and coriander), before being modified with the optional 
            spicy salsas, guac, radish, squeeze of lime and other extras of your choosing. 
            Here is everything you need to know about the most delicious of roadside snacks, 
            the taco.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>lb. 90% to 93% lean ground beef</li> 
            <li>1 Tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>  
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>   
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>12 taco shells - either hard shells or small 6-inch soft flour tortillas will work</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the beef to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break the meat apart with a wooden 
                spoon. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. 
                Stir well. Cook until the meat is cooked through, about 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to combine. Cook, 
                stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until some of the liquid evaporates but the meat 
                mixture is still a little saucy. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Warm the taco shells according to their package directions.</li>
            <li>Fill the taco shells with 2 heaping tablespoons of taco meat. Top with desired taco toppings: 
                shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, diced red onion, taco sauce, sour cream, 
                guacamole, etc.</li>
        </ol>
