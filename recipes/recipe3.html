        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups sushi rice(460 g), cooked</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup seasoned rice vinegar(60 mL)</li>
            <li>4 half sheets sushi grade nori</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame seed, optional</li>
            <li>8 pieces imitation crab</li>
            <li>1 small cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>1 avocado, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the sushi rice with the rice vinegar, fanning and stirring 
                until room temperature.</li>
            <li>On a rolling mat, place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing upwards.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice and place it on the nori. Spread 
                the rice evenly throughout the nori without mashing the rice down. Season 
                rice with a pinch of sesame seeds, if using, then flip it over so the nori 
                is facing upwards.</li>
            <li>Arrange, in a horizontal row 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom, the crab 
                followed by a row of avocado and a row of cucumber.</li>
            <li>Grabbing both nori and the mat, roll the mat over the filling so the 
                extra space at the bottom touches the other side, squeezing down to make a 
                nice tight roll. Squeeze down along the way to keep the roll from holding 
                its shape.</li>
            <li>Transfer the roll onto a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper towel 
                before slicing the roll into six equal portions.</li>
        </ol>
